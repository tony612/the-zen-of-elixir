# The Zen of Elixir

Mastering Elixir is *not easy*. This project tries to collect the most inspiring
resources about Elixir. It's not about teaching the basics, it's about the most important
things that every Elixir programmer should know.

There're articles, talks etc.. telling you these, but it can be hard to find as
Elixir beginners. That's why this project is created. *These resources are useful
and inspiring even if you don't program in Elixir (yet).*

(Check out [awesome-elixir](https://github.com/h4cc/awesome-elixir#resources)
for a list of books, tools, forums etc.. for Elixir)

## Erlang

* [The Zen of Erlang](http://ferd.ca/the-zen-of-erlang.html)  [中文](http://blog.aquarhead.me/2016/09/the-zen-of-erlang)

It's important to understand Erlang - not the syntax - if you want to be a master of Elixir.
Learn to think in *the BEAM way* by reading Fred's great article.

## Elixir

* [Beyond Functional Programming with Elixir and Erlang](http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2016/05/beyond-functional-programming-with-elixir-and-erlang/)

Erlang and Elixir are considered as functional languages. However, *it's not a goal*.
So what is the goal of Elixir? And how FP contributes to it? Read this to find out.

* [Comparing Elixir and Erlang variables](http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2016/01/comparing-elixir-and-erlang-variables/)

It can be confusing to understand rebinding of immutable variables in Elixir.
Let José explain this for you :)

* [Elixir in times of microservices](http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2015/06/elixir-in-times-of-microservices/)

Elixir excels at scalability and maintainability, but how to achieve this?
You should consider **umbrella projects** first for your great projects.

* [Mocks and explicit contracts](http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2015/10/mocks-and-explicit-contracts/)

Elixir is dynamic typed, so tests are important. It's functional, so it's very
different to write tests. Forget what you know and learn from this great post.

## Phoenix

* [Phoenix Is Not Your Application](http://www.elixirconf.eu/elixirconf2016/lance-halvorsen)
and [the discussion on elixirforum](https://elixirforum.com/t/phoenix-is-not-your-application-questions/735)

Phoenix is just an [application](http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/elixir/Application.html)
like other applications. So learn to think of Phoenix in this way from this talk.
